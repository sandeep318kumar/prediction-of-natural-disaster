# prediction-of-natural-disaster
hii,
this is "jock"team(sandeep kumar,shanu kumar,raushan kumar) participating  in codefun do++ 2018 event from national institute of technology warangal telangana india 506004
now, here we give our idea for prediction & prevention of natural disaster.
FOR EARTHQUAKE:
earthquake is a common phenomena in many countries.
for detection of it we can have a device which can detect the frequency of vibration of earth and any climate change. This device should be connected with other 
device which can send the signal(through message,whatsap,email,APP) to people so that they can be ready to face the situation.

FOR TSUNAMI,FLOOD:
This is also a common situation in many coastal area of contries.
we can have a device which store data. this data should includes land elevation models,dam and sea water level,historical flood data,infrastature location,construction 
type,location of evacuation center,population at risk in that area and weather & climatic data.This technology should analyses all these information sources and allows
us to run modelling of the impacts of various disaster event scenarios-such as storm event,sea level etc.. This information from this device help us understand
the impact that may take place and warn all the nearby peoples.

FOR WILD FIRE:
this is very common problem in forest area. Because of this a very large land area of forest convert into nothing and causes many problems to nature & human.To live on 
the earth we have to save trees,forests.This occur to wind flow,raise in temperature of forest & rubbing of stems of various trees.So,to predict it we should have a device 
which store data.This data should include temperature of forest,wind flowing speed,vapour pressure.If all these values are above from a optimum  level than the device should
inform the fire brigade peoples and also to nearby peoples,so that wild fire can be controlled and save a billion dollors loss.
thank you!!!
